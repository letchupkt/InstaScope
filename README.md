## FAQ
1. **Can I access the contents of a private profile?** No, you cannot get information on private profiles. You can only get information from a public profile or a profile you follow. The tools that claim to be successful are scams!
2. **What is and how I can bypass the `challenge_required` error?** The `challenge_required` error means that Instagram notice a suspicious behavior on your profile, so needs to check if you are a real person or a bot. To avoid this you should follow the suggested link and complete the required operation (insert a code, confirm email, etc)
